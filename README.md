# Stack_Visualizer
Stack Visualizer
This is a simple app that shows how a "stack" works, like a stack of plates where you can add or remove items only from the top. It has a nice interface with animations and buttons to help you see the stack in action.
What It Does

Add (Push): Add a number, letter, or word to the top of the stack.
Remove (Pop): Take the top item off the stack.
Look (Peek): See the top item without removing it.
Clear: Empty the stack.
Change Theme: Switch between light and dark colors.
Animations: Watch items fade in/out when added or removed.
History: See the last 10 actions you did.
Shortcuts: Use keyboard keys (Alt+P to add, Alt+O to remove, Alt+E to look, Alt+C to clear, Alt+T for theme).
